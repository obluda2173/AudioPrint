* General
Obviously for a Shazam "clone" project we would have to create a database that would contain all the relevant data regarding the songs.

For a role of a SQL database engine, we chose SQLite. Tha main reason for this is the simplicity to implement, as the project was planned to be relatively small.

* Thoughts
To create two tables, with one table being about the songs (e.g. containing song id, name, and artist), while other table would be focused on the fingerprint and song realtion (e.g. hash, song_id, offset).

* Phase 1: The Schema
We need a relational structure. A "Fingerprint" belongs to a "Song".

*Goal*: Create two tables:
- =Songs=: Stores metadata.
- =Fingerprints=: Stores acoustic hashes and crucially, when they happen in the song.
